🧠 RAG-based Text Processing with OpenAI API & ChromaDB

🚀 Overview

This project implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Python, OpenAI API, and ChromaDB. It processes text with GPT, converts it into vector embeddings, stores it in a database, and retrieves relevant answers based on similarity search.


🛠️ Tech Stack

Python – Core language
OpenAI API – Text generation & embeddings
ChromaDB – Vector database
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) – Improves response accuracy


🔍 How It Works

Generate Text – Uses OpenAI GPT to generate text
Text Chunking – Splits generated text into smaller segments
Vector Embeddings – Converts text chunks into vector embeddings
Store in ChromaDB – Saves embeddings for retrieval
Retrieve Answers – Queries database for the most relevant response
