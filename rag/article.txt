Dear shareholders, colleagues, customers, and partners,
We are living through a time of historic challenge and opportunity. As I write this, the world faces ongoing economic,
social, and geopolitical volatility. At the same time, we have entered a new age of AI that will fundamentally transform
productivity for every individual, organization, and industry on earth, and help us address some of our most pressing
challenges.
This next generation of AI will reshape every software category and every business, including our own. Forty-eight years
after its founding, Microsoft remains a consequential company because time and time again—from PC/Server, to Web/
Internet, to Cloud/Mobile—we have adapted to technological paradigm shifts. Today, we are doing so once again, as we
lead this new era.
Amid this transformation, our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve
more remains constant. As a company, we believe we can be the democratizing force for this new generation of
technology and the opportunity it will help unlock for every country, community, and individual, while mitigating its risks.
Here are just a few examples of how we are already doing this:
• Leading electronic health records vendor Epic is addressing some of the biggest challenges facing the
healthcare industry today—including physician burnout—by deploying a wide range of copilot solutions built
on Azure OpenAI Service and Dragon Ambient eXperience Copilot.
• Mercado Libre is reducing the time its developers spend writing code by more than 50 percent with GitHub
Copilot, as the company works to democratize e-commerce across Latin America.
• Mercedes-Benz is making its in-car voice assistant more intuitive for hundreds of thousands of drivers using
ChatGPT via the Azure OpenAI Service.
• Lumen Technologies is helping its employees be more productive, enabling them to focus on higher valueadded
activities, by deploying Microsoft 365 Copilot.
• Nonprofit The Contingent is matching foster families with children in need using Dynamics 365, Power BI, and
Azure, with an eye on using AI to amplify its work across the US.
• And, Taiwan’s Ministry of Education has built an online platform to help elementary and high school students
learn English using Azure AI.
To build on this progress, we remain convicted on three things: First, we will maintain our lead as the top commercial
cloud while innovating in consumer categories, from gaming to professional social networks. Second, because we know
that maximum enterprise value gets created during platform shifts like this one, we will invest to accelerate our lead in AI
by infusing this technology across every layer of the tech stack. And, finally, we will continue to drive operating leverage,
aligning our cost structure with our revenue growth.
As we make progress on these priorities, we delivered strong results in fiscal year 2023, including a record $211 billion in
revenue and over $88 billion in operating income.
A NEW ERA OF AI
There are two breakthroughs coming together to define this new era of AI. The first is the most universal interface: natural
language. The long arc of computing has, in many ways, been shaped by the pursuit of increasingly intuitive humancomputer
interfaces—keyboards, mice, touch screens. We believe we have now arrived at the next big step forward—
natural language—and will quickly go beyond, to see, hear, interpret, and make sense of our intent and the world around
us.
The second is the emergence of a powerful new reasoning engine. For years, we’ve digitized daily life, places, and things
and organized them into databases. But in a world rich with data, what has been most scarce is our ability to reason over
it. This generation of AI helps us interact with data in powerful new ways—from completing or summarizing text, to
detecting anomalies and recognizing images—to help us identify patterns and surface insights faster than ever.
Together, these two breakthroughs will unlock massive new opportunity. And, in fact, just last month we announced our
vision for Copilot, an everyday AI companion. We are building Copilot into all our most used products and experiences
and allowing people to summon its power as a standalone app as well. Just like you boot up an OS to access applications
or use a browser to visit websites today, our belief is that you will invoke a Copilot to do all those activities and more: to
shop, to code, to analyze, to learn, to create.

As a company, any time we approach a transition like this, we do so responsibly. We believe AI should be as empowering
across communities as it is powerful, and we’re committed to ensuring it is responsibly built and designed, with safety in
mind from the outset.
OUR OPPORTUNITY
Every customer solution area and every layer of our tech stack will be reimagined for the AI era. And that’s exactly what
we’ve already begun to do:
Infrastructure
Four years ago, we first invested in our AI supercomputer, with a goal of building the best cloud for training and inference.
Today, it’s being used by our partner OpenAI to power its best-in-class foundation models and services, including one of
the fastest-growing consumer apps ever—ChatGPT. NVIDIA, as well as leading AI startups like Adept and Inflection, is
also using our infrastructure to build its own breakthrough models.
More broadly, organizations continue to choose our ubiquitous computing fabric—from cloud to edge—to run their
mission-critical applications. We continued to see more cloud migrations to Azure this past fiscal year, as it remains early
when it comes to the long-term cloud opportunity. And we also continue to lead in hybrid computing with Azure Arc, which
now has 18,000 customers.
Data and AI
Every AI app starts with data, and having a comprehensive data and analytics platform is more important than ever. Our
Intelligent Data Platform brings together operational databases, analytics, and governance so organizations can spend
more time creating value and less time integrating their data estate. We also introduced Microsoft Fabric this year, which
unifies compute, storage, and governance with a disruptive business model.
With Azure AI, we are making foundation models available as platforms to our customers. We offer the best selection of
industry-leading frontier and open models. In January, we made the Azure OpenAI Service broadly available, bringing
together advanced models, including ChatGPT and GPT-4, with the enterprise capabilities of Azure. More than 11,000
organizations across industries are already using it for advanced scenarios like content and code generation. Meta chose
us this summer as its preferred cloud to commercialize its Llama family of models. And, with Azure AI Studio, we provide a
full lifecycle toolchain customers can use to ground these models on their own data, create prompt workflows, and help
ensure they are deployed and used safely.
Digital and app innovation
GitHub Copilot is fundamentally transforming developer productivity, helping developers complete coding tasks 55 percent
faster. More than 27,000 organizations have chosen GitHub Copilot for Business, and to date more than 1 million people
have used GitHub Copilot to code faster. We also announced our vision for the future of software development with
GitHub Copilot X, which will bring the power of AI throughout the entire software development lifecycle. All up, GitHub
surpassed $1 billion in annual recurring revenue for the first time this fiscal year.
We’re also applying AI across our low-code/no-code toolchain to help domain experts across an organization automate
workflows, create apps and webpages, build virtual agents, or analyze data, using just natural language with copilots in
Power Platform. More than 63,000 organizations have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform to date.
Business applications
We are bringing the next generation of AI to employees across every job function and every line of business with
Dynamics 365 Copilot, which works across CRM and ERP systems to reduce burdensome tasks like manual data entry,
content generation, and notetaking. In fact, our own support agents are using Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer Service
to resolve more cases faster and without having to call on peers to help. With our Supply Chain Platform, we’re helping
customers apply AI to predict and mitigate disruptions. And, with our new Microsoft Sales Copilot, sellers can infuse their
customer interactions with data from CRM systems—including both Salesforce and Dynamics—to close more deals.
All up, Dynamics surpassed $5 billion in revenue over the past fiscal year, with our customer experience, service, and
finance and supply chain businesses each surpassing $1 billion in annual sales.

Industry
Across industries, we are rapidly becoming the partner of choice for any organization looking to generate real value from
AI. In healthcare, for example, we introduced the world’s first fully automated clinical documentation application, DAX
Copilot. The application helps physicians reduce documentation time by half, freeing them to spend more time face to
face with patients. And Epic will integrate it directly into its electronic health records system.
And, in retail, we introduced new tools to help companies manage their day-to-day operations and digitize their physical
stores.
Modern work
We are rapidly evolving Microsoft 365 into an AI-first platform that enables every individual to amplify their creativity and
productivity, with both our established applications like Office and Teams, as well as new apps like Designer, Stream, and
Loop. Microsoft 365 is designed for today’s digitally connected, distributed workforce.
This year, we also introduced a new pillar of customer value with Microsoft 365 Copilot, which combines next-generation
AI with business data in the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft 365 applications to help people be more productive and
unleash their creativity at work. Just last month, I was excited to announce that we will make Microsoft 365 Copilot
generally available to our commercial customers later this year.
We continue to build momentum in Microsoft Teams across collaboration, chat, meetings, and calls. We introduced a new
version of Teams that delivers up to two times faster performance, while using 50 percent less memory. We also
introduced Teams Premium to meet enterprise demand for AI-powered features like intelligent meeting recaps. All up,
Teams usage surpassed 300 million monthly active users this year.
With Microsoft Viva, we have created a new category for employee experience. Copilot in Viva offers leaders a new way
to build high-performance teams by prioritizing both productivity and employee engagement. This year, Viva surpassed
35 million monthly active users.
Security
As the rate and pace of cyberthreats continue to accelerate, security is a top priority for every organization. Our
comprehensive, AI-powered solutions give defenders the advantage. With Security Copilot, we’re combining large
language models with a domain-specific model informed by our threat intelligence and 65 trillion daily security signals, to
transform every aspect of security operations center productivity.
All up, more than 1 million organizations now count on our comprehensive, AI-powered solutions to protect their digital
estates, and our security business surpassed $20 billion in annual revenue, as we help protect customers across clouds
and endpoint platforms.
Search, advertising, and news
We are reshaping daily search and web habits with our new Bing and Microsoft Edge browser, which brings together
search, browsing, chat, and AI into one unified experience to deliver better search, more complete answers, a new chat
experience, and the ability to generate content. We think of these tools as an AI copilot for the web.
We are also bringing these breakthrough capabilities to businesses, with Bing Chat Enterprise, which offers commercial
data protection, providing an easy on-ramp for any organization looking to get the benefit of next-generation AI today.
Although it’s early in our journey, Bing users engaged in more than 1 billion chats and created more than 750 million
images over the past year as they apply these new tools to get things done. And Edge has taken share for nine
consecutive quarters.
More broadly, we continue to expand our opportunity in advertising. This year, Netflix chose us as its exclusive technology
and sales partner for its first ad-supported subscription offering, a validation of the differentiated value we provide to any
publisher looking for a flexible partner to build and innovate with them.

LinkedIn
The excitement around AI is creating new opportunities across every function—from marketing, sales, service, and
finance, to software development and security. And LinkedIn is increasingly where people are going to learn, discuss, and
uplevel their skills. We are using AI to help our members and customers connect to opportunities and tap into the
experiences of experts on the platform. In fact, our AI-powered articles are already the fastest-growing traffic driver to the
network.
All up, LinkedIn’s revenue surpassed $15 billion for the first time this fiscal year, a testament to how mission critical the
platform has become to help more than 950 million members connect, learn, sell, and get hired.
Gaming
In gaming, we are rapidly executing on our ambition to be the first choice for people to play great games whenever,
wherever, and however they want. With Xbox Game Pass, we are redefining how games are distributed, played, and
viewed. Content is the flywheel behind the service’s growth, and our pipeline has never been stronger. It was especially
energizing to release Starfield this fall to broad acclaim, with more than 10 million players in the first month post-launch
alone.
Earlier this month, we were thrilled to close our acquisition of Activision Blizzard, and we look forward to sharing more in
the coming months about how, together, we will bring the joy of gaming to more people around the world.
Devices and creativity
Finally, we’re turning Windows into a powerful new AI canvas with Copilot, which rolled out as part of a Windows 11
update last month. It uniquely incorporates the context and intelligence of the web, your work data, and what you are
doing in the moment on your PC to provide better assistance, while keeping your privacy and security at the forefront.
Overall, the number of devices running Windows 11 more than doubled in the past year. And we are also transforming
how Windows is experienced and managed with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365, which together surpassed
$1 billion in annual revenue for the first time.
OUR RESPONSIBILITY
As we pursue our opportunity, we are also working to ensure technology helps us solve problems—not create new ones.
To do this, we focus on four enduring commitments that are central to our mission and that take on even greater
importance in this new era. For us, these commitments are more than just words. They’re a guide to help us make
decisions across everything we do—as we design and develop products, shape business processes and policies, help our
customers thrive, build partnerships, and more—always asking ourselves critical questions to ensure our actions are
aligned with them.
How can we expand opportunity?
First, we believe access to economic growth and opportunity should reach every person, organization, community, and
country. And although AI can serve as a catalyst for opportunity and growth, we must first ensure everyone has access to
the technologies, data, and skills they need to benefit.
To achieve this, we are focused on getting technology into the hands of nonprofits, social entrepreneurs, and other civil
society organizations to help them digitally transform, so they can help address some of society’s biggest challenges. This
year, we provided nonprofits with over $3.8 billion in discounted and donated technology. Nearly 325,000 nonprofits used
our cloud. And to help them tap the potential of AI, we’re building new AI capabilities for fundraising, marketing, and
program delivery.
AI will displace some jobs, but it will also create new ones. That’s why we aim to train and certify 10 million people by
2025 with the skills for jobs and livelihoods in an increasingly digital economy. Since July 2020, we’ve helped 8.5 million
people, including 2.7 million this year. We’ve also focused on skilling women and underrepresented communities in
cybersecurity, working across 28 countries and with nearly 400 US community colleges to scale our efforts.
Finally, to help people learn more about AI, we launched the first online Professional Certificate on Generative AI in
partnership with LinkedIn Learning, created AI tools for educators, and held our first AI Community Learning event in the
US. These events will be replicated around the world and localized in 10 languages over the next year. We also partnered
to launch a Generative AI Skills Grant Challenge to explore how nonprofit, social enterprise, and research or academic
institutions can empower the workforce to use this new generation of AI.

How can we earn trust?
To create positive impact with technology, people need to be able to trust the technologies they use and the companies
behind them. For us, earning trust spans the responsible use of AI, protecting privacy, and advancing digital safety and
cybersecurity.
Our commitment to responsible AI is not new. Since 2017, we’ve worked to develop our responsible AI practice,
recognizing that trust is never given but earned through action.
We have translated our AI principles into a core set of implementation processes, as well as tools, training, and practices
to support compliance. But internal programs aren’t enough. We also enable our customers and partners to develop and
deploy AI safely, including through our AI customer commitments and services like Azure AI Studio, with its content safety
tooling and access to our Responsible AI dashboard.
Building AI responsibly requires that we work with other industry leaders, civil society, and governments to advocate for AI
regulations and governance globally. This year, we released our Governing AI Blueprint, which outlines concrete legal and
policy recommendations for AI guardrails. We are signatories to the eight voluntary commitments developed with the US
White House, and proud of the six additional commitments we’ve made to further strengthen and operationalize the
principles of safety, security, and trust.
The era of AI heightens the importance of cybersecurity, and we deepened our work across the private and public sectors
to improve cyber-resilience. We’ve continued to support Ukraine in defending critical infrastructure, detecting and
disrupting cyberattacks and cyberinfluence operations, and providing intelligence related to these attacks. Our Microsoft
Threat Analysis Center team produced more than 500 intelligence reports to help keep customers and the public
informed. And we published our third annual Microsoft Digital Defense Report, sharing our learnings and security
recommendations.
We also remain committed to creating safe experiences online and protecting customers from illegal and harmful content
and conduct, while respecting human rights. We supported the Christchurch Call Initiative on Algorithmic Outcomes to
address terrorist and violent and extremist content online. And through the World Economic Forum’s Global Coalition for
Digital Safety, we co-led the development of new global principles for digital safety.
Protecting customers’ privacy and giving them control of their data is more important than ever. We’ve begun our phased
rollout of the EU Data Boundary, supporting our commercial and public sector customers’ need for data sovereignty. And
each month, more than 3 million people exercise their data protection rights through our privacy dashboard, making
meaningful choices about how their data is used.
How can we protect fundamental rights?
In an increasingly digital world, we have a responsibility to promote and protect people’s fundamental rights and address
the challenges technology creates. For us, this means upholding responsible business practices, expanding connectivity
and accessibility, advancing fair and inclusive societies, and empowering communities.
In 2023, we worked diligently to anticipate harmful uses of our technology and put guardrails on the use of technologies
that are consequential to people’s lives or legal status, create risk of harm, or threaten human rights. We will continue to
assess the impact of our technologies, engage our stakeholders, and model and adopt responsible practices and respect
for human rights—including across our global supply chain.
Today, our lives are more connected than ever. Access to education, employment, healthcare, and other critical services is
increasingly dependent on technology. That’s why we’ve expanded our commitment to bring access to affordable highspeed
internet to a quarter of a billion people around the world, including 100 million people in Africa, by the end of 2025.
Since 2017, we’ve helped bring internet access to 63 million people, a key first step to ensuring communities will have
access to AI and other digital technologies.
This year, we also continued working toward our five-year commitment to bridge the disability divide with a focus on
helping close the accessibility knowledge gap. Seven hundred and fifty-thousand learners enriched their understanding of
disability and accessibility in partnership with LinkedIn Learning, Teach Access, and the Microsoft disability community.
In addition, we’re stepping up efforts to combat online disinformation through new media content provenance technologies
—enabling users to verify if an image or video was generated by AI. We continued our efforts to promote racial equity
across Microsoft, our ecosystem, and our communities, including our work to advance justice reform through data-driven
